FILE "Lab Experiment Datasets.xlsx" corresponds to experimental data used Figure 2

FILE "KML.rar" contains detailed procedure of how to process the river planform reported in Finotello et al. (Sci.Rep., 2020), https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56992-w, which is used in Figure 4. The procedure is divided into two parts: Data_Outout_P1.m and Data_Outout_P2.m

Row order
Run A: considering only fluvial erosion and, hence, neglecting bank collapse
Run B1: taking into account the intermittent nature of bank collapse events employing the novel framework, the bank height under reference uniform flow conditions is set to 1.5 m
Run B2: taking into account the intermittent nature of bank collapse events employing the novel framework, the bank height under reference uniform flow conditions is set to 3 m
Run B3: taking into account the intermittent nature of bank collapse events employing the novel framework, the bank height under reference uniform flow conditions is set to 5 m
Beaver~Yana: Name of rivers reported in Finotello et al. (Sci.Rep., 2020)

Column order
1      Type of simulation or name of the observed rivers, see above
2-6    Statistics of the bend intrinsic length (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis and standard deviation)
7-11   Statistics of the bend sinuosity (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis and standard deviation)
12-16  Statistics of the bend asymmetry index (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis and standard deviation)
17-21  Statistics of the ratio between the bend asymmetry index and sinuosity (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis and standard deviation)
